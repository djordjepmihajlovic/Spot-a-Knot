# Spot-a-Knot ðŸª¢
Spot-a-Knot IOS App source code


IOS App developed to teach people about the complexities of knot classification and the need for a universal knot invariant.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic game idea:

1.) A knot followed by it's name, alexander polynomial and other interesting characteristics is presented; this is the question or 'knot to spot' if you will.
2.) 4 options are presented in a tabular view similarly in style to the question. 
3.) !!beta!! The user has a short time period (may implement level difficulty options, H: 5s, M: 10s, E: 30s) do decide which knot is being presented.

The central idea is this will be very easy the first 4/5 levels however as the number of crossings increases the capability to decifer between the knots falls apart.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future Ideas:

-Knot character collection (every knot you guess correctly is added to a 'bank').
-Brief summary at end after failing level: not only is it difficult to visually decifer between these knots but difficult mathematically.
-Knot images rotate randomly.
-Knots in questions are chosen randomly.

Current Issues:

-Unable to add image to label.
